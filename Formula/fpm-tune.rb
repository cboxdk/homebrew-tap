# Homebrew formula for fpm-tune — the SOURCE template.
#
# Versioned with the code so the formula can never describe a build that does not
# exist. The checksums are placeholders on purpose: they only exist once a release
# has been built, and `scripts/publish-formula.py` fills them in from the release's
# SHA256SUMS and pushes the result to cboxdk/homebrew-tap. A formula with
# real-looking digests nobody verified is worse than one that obviously is not ready.
#
# There is deliberately no `service` block: on a real host fpm-tune runs under
# systemd with --apply, managing a live PHP-FPM — not via `brew services`.
